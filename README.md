# Improved-JoinLeave-System

* Optimized (low runtime).
* Displays players joining your server, finishing loading, leaving your server (chat).


* Block any attempt to spam (chat) when the player joins, and influence the network.

* Define a particular group to display the message when a player leaves your server.
* Ability to block a particular name when a player joins your server (example: Discord.gg)
* Possibility to set a delay.
* Full configuration (lua/configuration).

When I saw the scripts available on the workshop or other sites, it's not possible that we can give this to the server owner, I saw a lot of code very poorly optimized and very badly written, and that adds no interesting feature.

If you have a lot of players on your server, and suddenly a lot of them join and some of them start spamming to join, this will block them and prevent any abuse of the network.
